                        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Charion Co.,Ltd（Head office：Tokyo、CEO：Tsunoda Teppei）, which is one of the leading<br>
firms specialized in oral care, recently donated 1000 sets of toothbrushes and toothpaste for cavity prevention to the Japan Asia Promotion Foundation (JAPF), a nonprofit organization that supports orphanages, school construction, and employment assistance for underprivileged families in Cambodia. This donation was made with the aim of promoting the dental health of children in Cambodia.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
During this initiative, with the cooperation of local Japanese dentists, we conducted health check-ups and examinations. It was found that on average, each child had more than 10 cavities, and many of them did not have the habit of brushing their teeth after meals.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We provided instructions on how to brush teeth using illustrations and models, and we could see that the children were attentively listening and learning.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
Charion is dedicated to supporting children by allocating a portion of its sales.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We conduct activities nationwide in Japan to educate children about dental knowledge and proper brushing techniques, aiming to raise awareness of preventive dentistry and oral health.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Furthermore, we provide support by donating dental supplies such as toothbrushes to orphanages in developing countries, both within Japan and abroad, ensuring that these resources reach the hands of children in need.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Under the company’s guiding principle of “Making the best smile over the world,” Charion will continue its support for the dental health of children in the future.<br>

Charion Co., Ltd., which develops state-of-the-art dental oral care product services, is pleased to announce that our company has been published in Forbes Japan released on February 25, 2023.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Forbes is a global media company, focusing on business, investing, technology, entrepreneurship, leadership, and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Our group’s efforts and thoughts are told in the article.<br>
Since oral health has a great impact on overall health, more emphasis should be placed on daily prevention. In the Western countries, people are already aware of dental health.<br>
While oral care, including teeth whitening, is relatively popular in Europe and US, awareness of teeth is still low in Asian countries.<br>
Therefore, Charion is focusing on overseas expansion, mainly in Asian countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img src="https://charion.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hyousi.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
In order to realize our mission of “To make the best smile all over the world”, We are committed to delivering the approachable oral care service to everyone in the world.<br>
We appreciate your continued support and guidance.<br>
